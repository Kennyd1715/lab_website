Words can be simple, consisting of a single morpheme such as "*lock*". Or they can be complex, with 2 or more morphemes such as "*lock-able*" or "*un-lock-able*".

From these examples, we see that one way to think of a **morpheme**  as  "*the smallest meaningful unit in a given language*". 

**Inflectional** morphemes modify a word’s grammatical properties (e.g. tense, number, person, aspect) 
For example "*lock*" → "*locked*" or "*locks*"  or "*locking*"
