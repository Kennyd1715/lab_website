title: Individual differences in reading and visual spatial learning
---

Together with Jay Rueckl and Oliver Sawi at UConn, we are investigating individual differences in complex word recognition.

<!--more-->

Individual differences in the capacity for statistical learning are linked with variability in word reading accuracy.  However, we still do not have a clear understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to these associations. One possibility is that deficits in statistical learning lead to an insensitivity to internal word structure and hence to word reading difficulty.  Our goal in this project funded by RI-INBRE is to examine the extent to which individual differences in implicit statistical learning impact word recognition.
