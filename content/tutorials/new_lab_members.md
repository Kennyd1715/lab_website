Welcome to the **Providence College Human Psychophysiology Lab**.  We are delighted to have you join our team!

<!--more-->

In our lab, we focus on questions about how we read, and in particular what kinds of brain processes underlie our abiity to read complex words&mdash;that is words that have more than one *part* or *morpheme*, such as a word like "sing-er".  We try to answer questions about how we read words by measuring people's brain responses as they read, using a techniqe called **event related potentials** or **ERPs**

You can learn more about ERPs by taking [Steve Luck's free online course](https://courses.erpinfo.org/courses/Intro-to-ERPs) designed for people with no prior ERP experience who want to learn the basics of ERPs. It typically takes 3-5 hours to complete.


Feel free to explore the tutorial links on this page as well as the other tutorials and guides on our website!
