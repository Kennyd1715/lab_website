 Netlify is a web hosting infrastructure and automation technology company that the process for developers to deploy and host a website.
 
<!--more-->

Netlify operates through your GitHub repository and runs a build process to pre-render all your pages in static HTML.

Netlify creates its own repository that pushes to Github and its own microservices. It then executes and distributes content across a wide content delivery network or CDN to deliver pre-built static websites to visitors.
 
This results in pre-built websites that load faster than on traditional hosting networks. Instead of loading the site for each visit, the visitor gets a pre-loaded version straight from the closest server. This sharply reduces load times.

[This website](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/) provides a step-by-step guide how to host a static website on Netlify, including setting up continuous deployment.
