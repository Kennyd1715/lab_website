&nbsp;

A statistical model is means to capture the structure of the data as simply as possible. Put another way, our goal is to find the model that most efficiently and accurately summarizes how the data were generated.

# Linear Models

We use regression to predict a dependent variable from one or more independent variables.  Regression gives us an equation that describes the *form* of the relationship between dependent and independent variables and predicts the *value* of the dependent variable based on the independent variable(s)

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
Ordinary least squares fits models of the form `$\hat{Y}$`

# Dealing with Problems in model fitting

## Heteroskedasticity

Heteroscedasticity means unequal scatter. In regression analysis, we talk about heteroscedasticity in the context of the residuals or error term. Specifically, heteroscedasticity is a systematic change in the spread of the residuals over the range of measured values. Heteroscedasticity is a problem because ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes that all residuals are drawn from a population that has a constant variance (homoscedasticity).
