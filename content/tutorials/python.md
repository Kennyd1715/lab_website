In the lab we use [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl), an experiment builder based on [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/), to program our studies.

Python is a popular programming language with a  simple, easy to learn syntax that emphasizes readability. 

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is a distribution of Python for scientific computing. Anaconda has many very useful third-party libraries such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) built in, so installing Anaconda is much easier than the regular Python installation. 

[Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) is a GUI tool that is included in the Anaconda distribution and makes it easy to configure, install, and launch tools such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), an open-source web application that allows data scientists to create and share documents that integrate live code, equations, computational output, visualizations, and other multimedia resources, along with explanatory text in a single document.  [This article](https://odsc.medium.com/why-you-should-be-using-jupyter-notebooks-ea2e568c59f2) explains the benefits of using Jupyter.
