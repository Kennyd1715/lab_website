# How to modify the values on one column in a set of files

You can accomplish this task with any of the scripting or programming languages you mentioned. Since you are already familiar with several environments, I would suggest the following based on ease and suitability for batch processing:

1. **Shell Script (with `sed` command)**: Shell scripting is a good option, especially if you are comfortable using the terminal and want to quickly manipulate files. Here's an example using `sed`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   for file in *.csv; do
       # Use sed to replace '4' with '5' and '5' with '6' in the 11th column
       awk -F, -v OFS=, '{if ($11==4) $11=5; else if ($11==5) $11=6;}1' "$file" > temp && mv temp "$file"
   done
   ```

   - This script will loop over all CSV files and modify the 11th column.
   - `awk` is used for precise column-based manipulation.

2. **Python (with pandas)**: If you're comfortable with Python, using pandas is a flexible and powerful approach. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import os

   # List of files
   files = ["A_block1a.csv", "A_block1b.csv", "A_block2a.csv", "A_block2b.csv", "A_block3a.csv", "A_block3b.csv", 
            "A_practice_block.csv", "B_block1a.csv", "B_block1b.csv", "B_block2a.csv", "B_block2b.csv", 
            "B_block3a.csv", "B_block3b.csv", "B_practice_block.csv"]

   # Process each file
   for file in files:
       df = pd.read_csv(file)
       df.iloc[:, 10] = df.iloc[:, 10].replace({4: 5, 5: 6})
       df.to_csv(file, index=False)
   ```

   - This will replace the values in the 11th column for all files in the list.
   - You can easily handle large dataframes with pandas.

3. **MATLAB**: If you're working in MATLAB already, you could use it to manipulate the CSV files:

   ```matlab
   files = {'A_block1a.csv', 'A_block1b.csv', 'A_block2a.csv', 'A_block2b.csv', 'A_block3a.csv', 'A_block3b.csv', ...
            'A_practice_block.csv', 'B_block1a.csv', 'B_block1b.csv', 'B_block2a.csv', 'B_block2b.csv', ...
            'B_block3a.csv', 'B_block3b.csv', 'B_practice_block.csv'};
   
   for i = 1:length(files)
       data = readtable(files{i});
       data{data{:,11} == 4, 11} = 5;
       data{data{:,11} == 5, 11} = 6;
       writetable(data, files{i});
   end
   ```

   - This will loop through each file and change the 11th column accordingly.

**Recommendation**: If you're looking for a quick and efficient solution, the shell script is fast for this type of simple task. However, if you need more flexibility or error handling, Python (with pandas) might be the better choice.
