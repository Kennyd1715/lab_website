To analyse  our ERP data we use [ERPLAB Toolbox](https://erpinfo.org/erplab). 

<!--more-->

ERPLAB is an open-source Matlab package, that extended the capabilites of another open-source Matlab package for EEG data analysis, the [EEGLAB Toolbox](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php). 

This description of the [basic ERPLAB processing steps](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Basic-ERPLAB-Processing-Steps) provides an overview of the typical sequence of operations for analyzing an ERP experiment using the combination of EEGLAB and ERPLAB. 

In order to use EEGLAB and ERPLAB efficiently, and particularly to use EEGLAB functions in MATLAB scripts, it is important to understand the [data structures](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/ConceptsGuide/Data_Structures.html) that EEGLAB uses.

These include the [EEG and ALLEEG structures](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/ConceptsGuide/Data_Structures.html#eeg-and-alleeg) and the [STUDY structure](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/ConceptsGuide/Data_Structures.html#the-study-structure).

Access the ERPLAB tutorial [here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Getting-Started:-Tutorial). Access the EEGLAB tutorial [here](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/).

Although a graphical user interface for EEGLAB and ERPLAB makes it easy for beginners to learn,  Matlab scripting provides much greater power and flexibility. Access the scripting tutorial [here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Scripting-Guide)
