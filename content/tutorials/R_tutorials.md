We do statistical analysis of our data using R, or more formally [The R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). 
<!--more-->

R is not just a a statistics application, but a full-fledged programming language. R allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. You should think of R as an **environment** within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended via **packages**. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. (You must install R before you can install RStudio.) Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It allows users to import CSV, Excel, SAS (*.sas7bdat), SPSS (*.sav), and Stata (*.dta) files into R without having to write the code to do so.

### Introductory Texts


[*R for Non-Programmers: A Guide for Social Scientists* by Daniel Dauber](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/)

This introductory textbook does not assume or expect any prior knowledge or skills in programming or statistical analysis. Instead, this book offers a comprehensive entry to R programming for novices and more experienced analysts wishing to migrate from other computational software.

[*Modern Data Science with R* by Benjamin S. Baumer, Daniel T. Kaplan, and Nicholas J. Horton](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/)

A comprehensive data science textbook for undergraduates that incorporates statistical and computational thinking to solve real-world problems with data.

[*Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse* by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim](https://moderndive.netlify.app/index.html)

In this book, students gain experience with the whole data analysis pipeline. In particular, *ModernDive* is one of the few intro stats textbooks that teaches students how to wrangle data. *ModernDive* carefully walks the students through each new function it presents and provides frequent reinforcement through the many Learning checks dispersed throughout the chapters.


[*Data Analysis and Processing with R based on IBIS data* by Kevin Donovan](https://bookdown.org/kdonovan125/ibis_data_analysis_r4/)

Donovan notes that much of the and content and structure of these tutorials will be based on Hadley Wickham’s excellent book *R for Data Science*. For those who want more detail and some exercises for the techniques detailed here, he recommmends going through Wickham’s book (see link in "Advanced Texts" below).
 
 [*Data Science in R: A Gentle Introduction* by James Scott](https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/)

This book assumes no knowledge of R. It is structured as a series of walk-through lessons that cover both the core ideas of data science as well as the concrete software skills that will help translate those ideas into practice.


[*R Software Handbook*](https://bookdown.org/aschmi11/RESMHandbook/)

This is an R handbook for ESM (Evaluation, Statistics, and Methodology) students prepared by faculty at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This handbook takes students from installation and set up, to data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. This guide uses survey data from the [RStudio Learning R Survey](https://github.com/rstudio/r-community-survey). It also includes data from built-in R data sets and simulated data.

[*Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners* by Danielle Navarro](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)

In early 2011, Danielle Navarro started teaching an introductory statistics class for psychology students offered at the University of Adelaide, using the R statistical package as the primary tool. The lecture notes for the class were expanded into a book which is freely available, and as of version 0.6 it is released under a creative commons licence (CC BY-SA 4.0)





### Advanced Texts 

[Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html)

[Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io) This is the website for “Advanced R Solutions” which provides solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R, 2nd edition.

[R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

[*Data Analysis* in R by Steve Midway](https://bookdown.org/steve_midway/DAR/)

This book has an excellent chapter (Chapter 5) on model fitting, model selection and parameter estimation.

[An Introduction to R by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto & David Lusseau](https://intro2r.com)

I like this book because it focuses on reproducible research practices and covers topics such as  creating reproducible reports and version control. From the text: "the single biggest reason to use R is that it facilitates robust and reproducible research practices... writing code to perform your analysis ensures you have a permanent and accurate record of all the methods you used (and decisions you made) whilst analysing your data...This is one of the tenets of open science." 

[YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel D. Phillips](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)

I found this book very helpful when I needed to use base graphics. From the text: "This book is meant to introduce you to the basic analytical tools in R, from basic coding and analyses, to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical inference."  

[*Functional Programming*](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu)

This book is a practical introduction to functional programming using the tidyverse. I like it because it focuses on the basics: common data structures such as atomic vectors, lists, and tibbles,  different types of functions such as vector, scalar, predicate, and anonymous, and finally it introduces the `purrr` package which contains a set of useful functions for iterating over data structures

### Graphics

[R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition by Winston Chang](https://r-graphics.org)

The *R Graphics Cookbook* is a practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe works.

### Principle Components Analysis in R

Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

# Blogdown and R Markdown

We use the an R package called [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to create our website. Blogdown creates web content using either [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) or [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) 


# Quarto

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses `knitr` to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing .Rmd files without modification.
