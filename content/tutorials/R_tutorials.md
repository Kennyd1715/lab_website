We do statistical analysis of our data using R, or more formally [The R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/).

R is not just a a statistics application, but a full-fledged programming language. R allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. You should think of R as an **environment** within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. (You must install R before you can install RStudio.) Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. It allows users to import CSV, Excel, SAS (*.sas7bdat), SPSS (*.sav), and Stata (*.dta) files into R without having to write the code to do so.
