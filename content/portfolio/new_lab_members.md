Welcome to the **Providence College Human Psychophysiology Lab**.  We are delighted to have you join our team!

<!--more-->

In our lab, we focus on questions about how we read, and in particular what kinds of brain processes underlie our abiity to read complex words&mdash;that is words that have more than one *part* or *morpheme*, such as a word like "sing-er".  We try to answer questions about how we read words by measuring people's brain responses as they read, using a techniqe called **event related potentials** or **ERPs**

You can learn more about ERPs by taking Steve Luck's free online course designed for people with no prior ERP experience who want to learn the basics of ERPs. It typically takes 3-5 hours to complete. To take the course click [here](https://courses.erpinfo.org/courses/Intro-to-ERPs).

The PCHPL website serves as a repository for much of the information you will need to work effectively and productively in the lab. Creating new content for the website and updating what is already here is an ongoing process and we would love for you to get involved in this necessary part of the lab workflow.  Here's what you will need to know to get started:
