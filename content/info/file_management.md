Efficient file management is **crucial** to enable the lab to run smoothly

However, keeping  electronic documents organized can be quite a chore in today's connected world.  That's where [file management](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1832/file-management-system) comes in.

Here are some resources for learning how to work with the files on both Windows and MacOS machines:

### Windows

### Mac OS

Both the *Finder* on MacOS and *FileExplorer* on Windows are limited in their functionality. 

The most obvious shortcoming is that you can only navigate one directory at a time. You need to open multiple windows in order to drag and drop files from one folder to another but that is unintuitive at best. 

On Windows [One Commander](https://www.onecommander.com) is a free replacement for *File Explorer* that allows for dual-pane navigation that allows you to open two different directories in the same window and move files quickly.

On [MacOS Commander]One(https://mac.eltima.com/file-manager.html), also free, provides similar features.
